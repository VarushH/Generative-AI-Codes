        You are required to compute the amount of reversal of input tax credit as per rule
        42(1)(i) of the CGST Rules, 2017 of the month of January 2023.
        Note: Each unit of exempted final product needs 2 units of raw materials.

        Assumed that there is no process loss.                 [8]

Answer:

(a) The consequences of transportation of goods without issue of invoice:
  (1) Cases where delivery challan can be issued instead of invoice: The consigner issue a
  delivery challan, serially numbered not exceeding 16 characters, in one or multiple series, in
  lieu of invoice at the time of removal of goods for transportation, containing the following
  purposes:
    (i) supply of liquid gas where the quantity at the time of removal from the place of business

       of the supplier is not known,
    (ii) transportation of goods for job work
    (iii)transportation of goods for other than by way of supply, or
    (iv) such other supplies as may be notified by the board
  (2) Number of copies of delivery challan: The delivery challan shall be prepared in triplicate.
  (3) Declaration: Where goods are being transported on a delivery challan in lieu of invoice, the

  same shall be declared as specified in E-way bill.
  (4) tax invoice to be issued after delivery of goods: [rule 55(4)] where the goods are being
  transported are for the supply to the recipient but the tax invoice could not be issued at the time
  removal of goods for the purpose of supply, the supplier shall issue a tax invoice after delivery
  of goods.
  (5) Goods transported in CKD/SKD condition or in batches /lots: Where the goods are being
  transported in a semi knocked down or completely knocked down condition or in batches or
  lots:

    The supplier shall issue a delivery challan for each of the subsequent consignment, giving
     reference of the invoice.

    Each consignment shall be accompanied by copies of the corresponding delivery challan
     along with a duly certified copy of the invoice.
    The original copy of the invoice shall be sent along with last consignment.


(b) Step 1: Calculate common input tax credit on inputs and input services which are used to
        supply taxable as well as exempted output supplies:

   Step 2: Amount of reversal of input tax credit attributable towards exempted supplies rule
   42(1)(i) of the CGST Rules, 2017 is as follows:
   (` 1,50,000/4,50,000) x ` 54,000 = ` 18,000/-

   Working Note:
   (i) Number of units of exempted final products 1,250 units (i.e. ` 1,00,000/` 80 per unit =
   1,250 units)
   (ii) Since, each unit of exempted final product needs 2 units of raw materials. Raw material
   used exclusively for exempted final product 2,500 units (i.e.1,250 units x 2 units = 2,500

   units).



7.  Answer the following:                                  [7+7=14]

    (a) Whether the benefit of zero rated supply can be allowed to all procurements by a
        SEZ developer or a SEZ unit such as event management services, hotel and

        accommodation services, consumables etc.?

    (b) Write a brief note on Special Audit under Section 66 of the CGST Act, 2017.

Answer:

(a) As per section 16(1) of the IGST Act, “zero rated supplies” means supplies of goods or services
  or both to a SEZ developer or a SEZ unit. Whereas, section 16(3) of the IGST Act provides for
  refund to a registered person making zero rated supplies under bond/LUT or on payment of
  integrated tax, subject to such conditions, safeguards and procedure as may be prescribed.
  Further, as per the second proviso to rule 89(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules,
  2017 (CGST Rules in short), in respect of supplies to a SEZ developer or a SEZ unit, the
  application for refund shall be filed by the:
  (A) supplier of goods after such goods have been admitted in full in the SEZ for authorised
     operations, as endorsed by the specified officer of the Zone;

  (B) supplier of services along with such evidences regarding receipt of services for authorised
     operations as endorsed by the specified officer of the Zone.



  Dos, The Institute of Cost Accountants of India (Statutory Body under an Act of Parliament) Page 11
     Answer   to MTP_Final_Syllabus     2016_Dec2023_Set1


  A conjoint reading of the above legal provisions reveals that the supplies to a SEZ developer or
  a SEZ unit shall be zero rated and the supplier shall be eligible for refund of unutilized input tax
  credit or integrated tax paid, as the case may be, only if such supplies have been received by the
  SEZ developer or SEZ unit for authorized operations. An endorsement to this effect shall have
  to be issued by the specified officer of the Zone.

  Therefore, subject to the provisions of section 17(5) of the CGST Act, if event management
  services, hotel, accommodation services, consumables etc. are received by a SEZ developer or a
  SEZ unit for authorised operations, as endorsed by the specified officer of the Zone, the benefit
  of zero rated supply shall be available in such cases to the supplier.
  Definition of turnover of zero-rated supplies of goods amended [Rule 89(4)(C)]

  [Notification No.16/2020 CT dated 23.03.2020]
  Lower of the two shall be taken:

  ● Zero Rated Value of supply of goods as per GST Invoice or
  ● 1.5 times the value of like goods domestically supplied by the same or, similarly placed
  supplier
  The formula is as follows:

  Refund Amount = (Turnover of zero-rated supply of goods + Turnover of zero-rated supply of
  services) × Net ITC Adjusted Total Turnover.

(b) Special Audit under Section 66 of the CGST Act, 2017: The law provides that Special audit
   under section 66 may be directed irrespective of any other audit have been conducted under
   any other provision of this Act or any other law for the time being in force or otherwise.
   Example: If an audit has been conducted by tax authorities under section 65 of The GST act,

   special audit under section 66 can still be directed irrespective of any Audit covered under any
   provisions of this Act or under any Act. The audit of accounts under any other provision or
   law will not have any relevance in conduct of special audit.
   Example: Suppose Tax Audit of a Company u/s 44AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was
   concluded. But if Assistant/ Deputy Commissioner during the course of scrutiny or
   investigation comes across any doubt regarding the nature and complexity of the case in
   respect to the Interest of Revenue, then also irrespective of any Audit covered under any
   provisions of this Act or under any Act, Special Audit u/s 66 of the CGST Act can be
   directed.

   The features of this Audit can be as follows:
     (1) It is conducted by Chartered Accountant/ Cost Accountant nominated by the
        commissioner.
     (2) Audit reports should be shown to Deputy/ Assistant Commissioner.

10. (a) The assessee-respondent had been importing “Orange Shock Tube” from the
        exporter at a unit price of US$0.0150 per ft till November, 2022 when the price
        was reduced to US$0.0141 per ft. However, in June, 2001, the importer declared

        the value of the imported tubes at a unit price of US$0.0100 per ft. Revenue
        contended that declared value was substantially lower than the actual value i.e.
        the assessee had under-valued the goods. Therefore, the value had to be

        determined as per erstwhile rule 5 of Customs Valuation Rules, 1988 [now rule4
        of Customs Valuation (Determination of value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007],
        viz., transactional value of identical goods. In this regard, the assessee provided

        the explanation that the reduction in price was subject to mutual agreement that
        he would purchase 100% of its annual requirement from the same exporter.

11. (a) Mr. X an importer imported certain goods CIF value was US $ 20,000 and
        quantity 1,000 Kgs. Exchange rate was 1 US $ = ` 50 on date of presentation of

        Bill of Entry. Customs Duty rates are — (i) Basic Customs Duty 12%(ii) SWS @
        10% There is no excise duty payable on these goods if manufactured in India. As
        per Notification issued by the Government of India, anti-dumping duty has been

        imposed on these goods. The anti-dumping duty will be equal to difference
        between amount calculated @ US $ 30 per kg and ‘landed value’ of goods.
        Compute Customs Duty liability and anti-dumping liability. [7]

    (b) Write down a comparative study on RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on
        Exported Products) and Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). [5]

Answer:
(a) Part I                                             `

  Total CIF Price/Assessable Value US $ 20,000 x ` 50 = 10,00,000
  Basic duty @ 12%                                = 1,20,000
  Sub-total                                       = 11,20,000
  Add: SWS 10% on ` 1,20,000                      = 12,000

  Value of imported goods                         = 11,32,000
  Total Customs Duty payable is ` 1,32,000.

  Part II
  Rate as per Anti-Dumping Notification is ` 15,00,000 [US $ 30 per kg x 1,000 Kgs x ` 50]

  Part III
  Computation of anti-dumping duty:

  Rate as per Anti-Dumping Notification = ` 15,00,000
  Less: Value of imported goods as computed above = ` (11,32,000)
  Anti-Dumping Duty payable = ` 3,68,000
