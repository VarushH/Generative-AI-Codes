The pain is described as a dull, pressure-like sensation, localized to the left side of the chest, and occasionally radiating to the left arm. No associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or syncope has been reported. Past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which are managed with medication. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease, with the patientâ€™s father experiencing a myocardial infarction at age 50. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities on auscultation of the heart or lungs. An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed during the visit shows no acute changes. The clinical presentation is suggestive of stable angina, and further evaluation with stress testing and potential coronary angiography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.\" "
